# skillsmaker — how a skill is written here

A skill is a **standing constraint**, not a script. It hands the model the invariants that must hold for
one kind of work, then trusts it to fly. Your one job: shape that constraint by the rules below — and
obey them in the skill you write, so it reads like its siblings.

## Rules & concepts

- **Crisp sentences.** Short, declarative, one idea a line. Cut every word that carries no load. Density
  over prose — a lozenge beats a paragraph.
- **Rules, not stages.** State what must be **true**, never a numbered `1 → 2 → 3` of what to do next.
  Steps ossify and go stale; invariants hold. Name sections by concept (`Gate`, `Ground first`,
  `Rules & concepts`) — never `Step 1`. A skill that scripts the order is a checklist, not a skill.
- **Invariants first.** Open the body with the non-negotiables — a `## Rules & concepts`
  block, or an `**Invariants:**` line. Everything after serves them.
- **Small.** One screen — aim under ~70 lines. Past that you're explaining, not ruling. Cut, or split a
  sibling reference file out beside `SKILL.md` (a template, an example) and point to it by name.
- **Bulletproof.** Close every loophole: `never`, `always`, the one exception spelled out inline. A rule
  the model can rationalize around is not a rule. Route forks out instead of guessing; add a `## Litmus`
  the reader can self-check against.
- **No hardcode.** Name the **concept** — the target, the features, the model — not baked-in file lists,
  magic values, or "then run X" the skill can't know. The invocation supplies the particulars. Hardcode
  rots; concepts hold. Only stable infra (a canonical path, a fixed subagent model) may be literal.
- **Bold lead-in per rule.** Every bullet opens with a two-or-three-word imperative in **bold**, then the
  rule. Skimmable at a glance, memorable as a slogan.
- **Frontmatter earns the load.** `name` is the invocation. `description` is the only line the router
  reads — pack it: open with **"Use when…"**, then the boundary and what it guarantees, and close with
  the literal phrases a human types. **Never the mechanism** — no step order, no subagent counts, no
  "then X": a description that summarises the *how* becomes a shortcut the model takes instead of
  reading the skill. `argument-hint` shows what to pass (`<required>` vs `[optional]`); a pure reference
  drops it, and it is never a note about the skill.
- **Self-exemplifying.** The skill obeys its own rules. One preaching brevity in a wall of prose is wrong.
- **English.** Identifiers, titles, prose — all English.
