name: stay-in-scope
description: "Use when the request is small or its edges are fuzzy and the pull is to build around it — pins the ask's boundaries as the spec: do exactly what was asked, flag noticed-but-unasked work instead of folding it in, then stop. The on-demand form of the stay-in-scope rule, for a project that hasn't installed it."

# stay-in-scope — do exactly what was asked, nothing extra

Deliver exactly what was asked, then stop. The common failure is the opposite — filling gaps with
guessed intent, building extra "while I'm here", solving problems no one raised — all of which makes
unrequested work the user then has to read, understand, and undo.

## Rules & concepts

- **Do what was asked, not what you imagine around it.** Treat the request's boundaries as the spec.
  Extra features, refactors, endpoints, or "improvements" that weren't requested are out of scope,
  however good they seem.
- **When intent is unclear, ask — don't guess.** If part of the task is ambiguous, surface it and get
  it settled rather than inventing a fuller version of the request and running with it.
- **A noticed-but-unasked problem is a flag, not a licence.** When you spot a nearby bug, cleanup, or
  bigger rewrite worth doing, name it and let the user decide; don't fold it in uninvited or quietly
  expand a small request into a big one.
- **Finish and stop.** Once the asked-for thing is done and verified, the task is over. Resist the pull
  to keep polishing, gold-plating, or padding the result with extras.
