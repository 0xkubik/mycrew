# architecture-management — the architecture, as a living tree

You describe and keep true the product's **structure** — not *what* to build (feature-management / what-to-do),
but *how* it's shaped. The architecture lives as **one living tree** in
`docs/architecture/model.c4` **at the product root**, spanning every sub-project; your job is to grow
and correct that tree by the rules below. LikeC4 syntax lives in **`mycrew-tools:likec4`** — load it
before editing.

**You own it — a worker never reshapes it.** A worker building in a repo reads this tree and builds to
it. When the work needs the shape to move, the worker says so in its report and you make the move here
first, then re-dispatch.

**Rules & concepts — non-negotiable:**
- **The tree's one axis: runtime interaction.** The tree answers a single question — *what talks to,
  calls, or depends on what, at run time.* Every node is a thing that **exists and interacts when the
  system runs** (a service, a process, a datastore, a deployed contract, an external system); every
  edge is a runtime interaction (calls, reads, publishes, forwards). This axis is the whole discipline
  below: a node that doesn't interact at run time, or an edge that isn't a runtime interaction, does
  not belong.
- **Always inside `model.c4`.** One unified model for the **whole product**, over that **one file**
  only — never scatter `.c4` files across the sub-projects or write architecture anywhere else.
- **Isolate the product — ship a `likec4.config.json`.** Next to `model.c4` sits a `likec4.config.json`
  with a unique `name` (e.g. `{ "name": "<product>", "title": "…" }`), so this model stands as its own
  LikeC4 project. Create it if it's missing. Without it, LikeC4 merges every config-less `.c4` in the
  workspace into one default project — and a sibling product's model bleeds into your index.
- **A tree, root → leaves — down one axis.** The root is a **high-level overview of the whole
  product**, and the **sub-projects are its first level** — one node per repo, each nesting its own
  interacting parts. Each node nests the finer *interacting* parts inside it (LikeC4 component nesting), down
  to the **finest interacting unit that still matters for reasoning**. Deeper means a smaller
  interacting unit of the **same** runtime-interaction axis — never a jump to a different axis (code
  structure, type hierarchy, deployment topology). Structure, not a flat list.
- **Everything reachable from the index.** Every component and every view must be reachable by
  navigation starting at the **index** — through drill-down (nesting) or an explicit `navigateTo`. A
  node or view you can't reach from the index is orphaned: wire it to where it belongs, or it doesn't
  exist for the reader. Standalone views (a dynamic flow) especially need a `navigateTo` pointing at them.
- **Code structure is a different axis — OUT.** Inheritance / `extends` / `is`, interface / ABI files,
  helper and math libraries, mixins, abstract base classes or base contracts, individual functions —
  these describe *how the source is organized to be reused*, not *what interacts at run time*. They are
  never nodes and never edges. **Litmus:** if you'd label an edge `extends` / `inherits` / `is`, or a
  node is *abstract / not deployed / a stateless helper lib*, it's the code axis — leave it OUT.
  codegraph already maps the code; if a code-structure picture is ever genuinely needed it is a
  **separate generated diagram**, never hand-carved into this tree. A significant implementation *fact*
  (an RNG source, a standard like ERC-7535, a gasless path) lives as a component's **description or a
  relationship** — never as its own code node.
- **Map the leaf to the domain's real unit.** A node is whatever independently **exists and interacts
  in this domain**: a running service or process (a backend), a deployed contract (on-chain), a
  datastore, an external system. Do **not** turn source groupings — folders, `src/*` dirs, packages,
  base classes — into nodes; they are code organization, not interacting units.
- **Living, not carved.** The tree is dynamic — nodes are **added, edited, and expanded** as the
  system's *shape* changes and is understood better. It is never "done" — but it moves with the
  **architecture**, not with every code edit.
- **Significant only — quantity ≠ quality.** Only architecturally-significant components and their
  real relationships belong. Not every file, class, or function is a node. Fewer, meaningful nodes;
  when in doubt, it stays **OUT**.
- **Short nodes.** The less text inside a component, the better — a crisp title, a minimal
  description. Meaning comes from the tree's **structure**, not prose stuffed in the nodes.
- **English.** Identifiers, titles, descriptions — all English.

## Working the tree

- **Place before you add.** Find where a component belongs — whose child it is — and nest it there;
  don't dump new nodes at the root.
- **Add / edit / expand as reality moves.** New component → a node under its parent. Something grew →
  expand it into subcomponents. Drifted, renamed, or gone → correct or prune the node.
- **Wire every new view.** A view reached by drill-down (a scoped element view) is fine as-is; one that
  isn't (a dynamic flow, a cross-cutting view) needs a `navigateTo` to it from the node or view where
  it belongs — so it stays reachable from the index.
- **One altitude per view.** A scoped view shows one zoom-level — a parent and the interacting units
  one level inside it. Don't put a deployed unit and its abstract base, or a service and another
  store's internals, in the same view; mixed altitudes are what make a diagram read as "half
  architecture, half code."
- **Deeper only where a design earns it.** Stop at the component level by default. Drill a branch
  deeper only where a specific design genuinely needs it to be reasoned about — and even then as
  finer components, never a code dump.
- Whether the source is the user's design or the actual code, the job is the same: keep the tree
  **true**, and let it grow.
